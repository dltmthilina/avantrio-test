# Part 1

1. I choose client server architecture. Client will be developed using ReactJS, ShadCN ui components and tailwindCSS. Backend will be developed using Express framework with NodeJS. This stack is suitable for developing a MVP and according to the nodejs event-driven architecture, easy to handle growing traffics with minimum memory spaces.

2. The ecommerce platform has different type of product and they have various features and product details does not follow exact data schema.Product details comsist of binary files also. And also ecommerce web applications, database access query rate is higher. so I choose NoSQL database for this system. It easily support horizontal scalling also when system is growing.

3. I am following separate frontend-backend architecture. Although If I go with separate frontend, it is better think about better SEO friendly frontend because this is ecommerce platform. When separate frontend and backend, they can be easily maintain and scale. Further we can implement a mobile app when popular the platform keeping same backend service.

4. I will use React for frontend and nodejs for backend. 

5.I will be deployed AWS since it assure 99.99% uptime and they provide pay-as-you-go pricing option. So I can run the system with minimal cost until growing. And also I can use Dynamodb as NoSQL database to store product data.
